Battleship is built in javascript and was an awesome partner project.
The design is fully responsive and though not finished, is one of my favorite projects.
I hope to re-build it as a Rails application and be able to finish the entire game.

The application plays against the computer, so the code generates a random placement for all the ships.
The finished project is supposed to lay out 2 five block ships, 2 four block ships, 2 three block ships, 2 two block ships, and 1 one block ship.
Each type of multi-block ships is supposed to have one horizontal and one vertical.

We are able to place both five block ships; 1 vertical and 1 horizontal.
